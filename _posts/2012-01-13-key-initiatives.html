			<h2>All relesable data and metadata will be published by 2018.</h2>
			<p>A clear message in the city tech plan is to continue to release more data. Chicago has released nearly 500 datasets, but gigabytes of data still needs to be published. By 2018, all relesable City of Chicago data will be published on the open data portal. The city will also publish all information on databases stored by the City of Chicago on Chicago's data dictionary by 2018.</p>
			<h2>City of Chicago and Cook County will consolidate data portal management.</h2>
			<p>Chicago's tech plan outlines a vision of deeper cooperation between Chicago's metro area governments to increase efficiency and quality of execution. Consolidated management will lead to better cooperation of data releases, helping fillt he topical gaps between city and county data. Both portals and metrochicagodata.org will persist in their state, but the content released on those systems will be released to supplement each other and helping translate data into information.</p>
			<h2>Open by default </h2>
			<p>Each datasets must be viewed as an item which should be published on the data portal unless it falls under one of the following exceptions:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Datasets which explicitly or implicitly reveal elements protected by municipal, state, or federal privacy acts.</li>
			<li>Datasets which would inappropriately publish personally identifiable information</li>
			<li>Datasets which are not being maintained by any department</li>
			<li>Data which are drafts or work products</li>
			<li>Data that would create a risk to the physical or cyber infrastructure of the city or its residents</li>
			</ul>			
			<h2>Open since inception</h2>
			<p>The city's efforts have focused on releasing data already captured by the city, but long-term sustainability of open data must account for new systems. The Chief Data Officer and Chief Procurement Officer will coordinate on creating a process to identify data to be released at procurement and implementation state of any procured system.</p>
			<h2>Text mining FOIA requests</h2>
			<p>Chicago will mine FOIA requests to identify frequently-requested datasets and prioritize their publication to the portal. FOIA logs, which were one of the first datasets to be released, provide a list and short description of requests from the city. Chicago's data science team will use that information to identify valuable datasets to assist in the prioritization of released data. The methodology and code driving that analysis will be released on the city's GitHub page.</p>
			<h2>Dataset requests</h2>
			<p>Chicago will released a new interface to request datasets through the data portal. The new interface will provide a public archive of dataset suggestions and requests.</p>
			<h2>Open Data status blog</h2>
			<p>Starting today, the City of Chicago will launch a new blog dedicated to updates for the data portal. In addition to @ChicagoCDO, the blog will be dedicated to providing customer service and feedback to those who depend on the portal with technical updates, outage notifications, and other technical information.</p>
