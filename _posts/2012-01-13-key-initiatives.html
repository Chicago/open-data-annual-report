			<h2>Open by Default</h2>
			<p>To promote government efficiency, economic growth, and other social goods, the Emanuel Administration will consider all City datasets to be open and machine readable. The City will publish datasets consistent with privacy, public safety, government efficiency, and the public interest.</p>
			<h2>Open Data Policy for Procurements That Collects or Manage Data</h2>
			<p>The City will work to develop contract provisions that promote open data in procurements that contain data systems, such as the City's Divvy bike share system. These provisions will promote the City's open data policies, and, where appropriate, require that data be posted on <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org">data.cityofchicago.org</a>.</p>
			<h2>Coordination between City and Cook County</h2>
			<p>Chicago's tech plan lays out a vision of deeper cooperation between Chicago's metro area governments to increase efficiency and quality of execution. Both governments will begin a deeper coordination of open data efforts to deliver higher value to residents and the public.</p>
			<h2>Text Mining FOIA Requests</h2>
			<p>Chicago will mine FOIA requests to identify frequently-requested datasets and prioritize their publication to the portal. FOIA logs, which served were one of the first datasets to be released, provide a list and short description of requests from the City. Chicago's advanced analytics team will begin using text mining techniques to identify frequently-requested datasets.</p>
			<h2>FOIA Request Reduction</h2>
			<p>One of the primary objectives of the City's open data policy in Chicago is to conserve City staff resources by reducing FOIA requests. As an example of the success of this policy, in the 9 months after releasing environmental records, the Department of Public Health (CDPH) experienced a 65% drop in the number of FOIA requests for environmental records.</p>
			<h2>Dataset requests</h2>
			<p>Chicago will release a new interface to request datasets through the data portal. The new interface will provide a public archive of dataset suggestions and requests. The new request mechanism will supplement requests made through emails to <a href="mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> and requests made to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ChicagoCDO">@ChicagoCDO</a>.</p>
			<h2>Open Data status blog</h2>
			<p>The City of Chicago will launch a new blog dedicated to updates for the data portal. In addition to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ChicagoCDO">@ChicagoCDO</a>, the blog will be dedicated to providing customer service and feedback to those who depend on the portal with technical updates, outage notifications, and other technical information.</p>
