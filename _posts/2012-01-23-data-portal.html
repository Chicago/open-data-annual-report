			<p class="blurb">Launched in May 2010, the portal has quickly grown in less than four years. The open data portal contains nearly 500 datasets on activities and information that shape the city and our lives. Visitors to the portal can get information on salaries for city employees, business licenses, energy consumption in each neighborhood, to where Chicagoans can recycle their Christmas trees. The data portal has helped spur a vibrant software development and data science community in Chicago .</p>

			<p class="blurb">The City of Chicago has minimized expenses by using automation to maintain data on the portal. Most datasets are refreshed each night without human involvement. The cost, however, has distinct benefits. Publishing data to the public helps reduce the number of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests received by the city. In one clear example, environmental requests received by the Department of Public Health were reduced by fifty percent. In addition, open data has permitted developers to create a wealth of applications to inform Chicago's residents and improve the day-to-day life.</p>
			<p class="blurb">Open data also helps reduce business cost or allow new ventures. Earlier this year, Chicago published a list of authorized <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/97wa-76ff">public chauffeurs</a>--a list of licensed drivers for taxis, limosuines, and other vehicles. Cab companies and other public chauffeurs can freely access up-to-date information on their cab drivers to guarantee that only licensed chauffeurs are on the streets.</p>
			<p class="blurb">Open data has permitted developers to create a wealth of applications for Chicago's residents. These applications range from browsing 311 requests, to reminding residents of street cleanings, to informing residents on the location and nuances of zoning laws. The data portal has enabled developers to meeting weekly at civic hack nights and help Chicago host over a dozen hackathons this past summer.</p>
