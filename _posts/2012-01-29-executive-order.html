		  <h1>Chicago Open Data Executive Order</h1>
		  <p>On December 10, 2012, Mayor Rahm Emanuel issued <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/narr/foia/open_data_executiveorder.html">Executive Order 2012-2</a> to codify his commitment to open data. The order requires each city agency to publish all appropriate datasets and associated metadata under such agency's control to the data portal.</p>
		  <p>The executive order appoints an Open Data Advisory Group comprised of Open Data Coordinators from each City department. The Open Data Advisory Group assists the Chief Data Officer and Department of Innovation and Technology in creating the Open Data Annual Report.</p>
		  <p>The City of Chicago's inaugural technology plan outlines several key objectives. First, continue to release more data to the public as part of creating a more efficient government. Second, expand the use of social and digital media to communicate with the public. Finally, consolidate local IT services to improve efficiency and quality of delivery.</p>
		<p>The City of Chicago will increase the presence of open data through the following key initiatives: 
		  <ul>
			<li>Release all data and information on all potential databases by 2018.</li>
			<li>Consolidate the administration of City of Chicago's and Cook County data portals.</li>
			<li>The policy for releasing data will be "open by default".</li>
			<li>Data will also be open since inception. Departments, at the time of procurement, will outline and identify publishable datasets and metadata at the outset.</li>
			<li>Chicago will create a new, public method to solicit suggestions for new datasets</li>
			<li>The city will create and maintain a new Open Data Status BLog to provide detailed feedback and status of the open data portal and data dictionary.</li>
			<li>The Open Data Annual Report will list datasets which will be targeted for publication in the upcoming year. This year, the city will target the publication of all 311 and 911 calls, in addition to XX more datasets.</li>
