		  <h1>Chicago Open Data Executive Order</h1>
		  <p>On December 10, 2012, Mayor Rahm Emanuel issued <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/narr/foia/open_data_executiveorder.html">Executive Order 2012-2</a> giving the open data effort in Chicago the force of law for the first time. The order requires each city agency to publish "all appropriate datasets and associated metadata under such agency's control" to the data portal.</p>
		  <p>The Executive Order created the Open Data Advisory group, comprised of an Open Data Coordinator from each department and chaired by the City's Chief Data Officer and the Department of Innovation and Technology in creating the Open Data Annual Report.</p>
		  <p>The annual report uses input from the Open Data Advisory Group and the City of Chicago inaugural technology plan as guidelines to direct future goals of the program. The tech plan outlines several meaningful objectives of the portal and the city. First, to continue to release more data to the public as part of creating a more efficient government. Second, expand the use of social and digital media to communicate with the public. FInally, consolidate local IT services to improve efficiency and quality of delivery</p>
		<p>From those objectives, Chicago will 
		  <ul>
			<li>Release all data and information on all potential databases by 2018.</li>
			<li>Consolidate the administration of City of Chicago's and Cook County data portals.</li>
			<li>The policy for releasing data will be "open by default".</li>
			<li>Data will also be open since inception. Departments, at the time of procurement, will outline and identify publishable datasets and metadata at the outset.</li>
			<li>Chicago will create a new, public method to solicit suggestions for new datasets</li>
			<li>The city will create and maintain a new Open Data Status BLog to provide detailed feedback and status of the open data portal and data dictionary.</li>
			<li>The Open Data Annual Report will list datasets which will be targeted for publication in the upcoming year. This year, the city will target the publication of all 311 and 911 calls, in addition to XX more datasets.</li>
